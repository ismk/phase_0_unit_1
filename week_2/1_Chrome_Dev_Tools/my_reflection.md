# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

	* The DOM represents the computed and finished document ready for the web, DOM basically converts the HTML and CSS 		  to identifiable objects that can be manipulated by JS. Through Document Object Model we can navigate the		  structure of the HTML and add, modify, or delete elements and content.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

	* Well my site was a lot cleaner all the styles and scripts were linked to external sources, but the wordpress site I 				compared with had all the styles in the styles tags and had the javascript in the script tags in the HTML, which I think 		is bad practice.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

 	* Chrome web tools are amazing, awesome asset for the developers to have, using it anyone can deconstruct any website. So 			yes they are definitely helpful.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

	* Yes there was a big "aha" moment when I understood why some of the styles in web tools were crossed off. It means that 			that particular style was been overridden by a more specific selector or by a later property within the same rule.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	* Oh yes the 30 days to HTML and CSS by nettuts really really helped me.
