# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: ismk.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
  * I read a lot of blogs explaining how the flow of a website works and what are the best practices to give the best experience to the user, also learned about the color theory and which colors compliment each other.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
  * Ofcourse who doesn’t like to have a good experience using any type of application, It was fun but also stressful when things didn’t work out the way I planned.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  * First laid out a simple design plan in photoshop, and tried to mimic the same effect to the web, somethings like layout and positioning didn’t work out as I hoped.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  * More responsiveness and better user experience for the user. Also more eye candy! (CSS transitions and effects) :P

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  * It wasn’t difficult as such, it was more in the lines of trial and error.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
