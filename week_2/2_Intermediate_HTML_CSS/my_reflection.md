# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
  * Web standards cannot be construed as either good or bad, it is how the web is made, of course with the rise of HTML5 and CSS3 a lot of progress has been made, but I think a lot more is to be desired.
  
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
  * Yes it does, everything is properly structured and has its own place in the DOM.
  
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
  * Oh yes a lot, it clears up the dreaded div-ititus, and makes the HTML more readable.
  
* Why is reset.css necessary?
  * Each browser comes with its own unique way of interpreting the DOM, and modifies the CSS accordingly, in Chrome it adds a padding of 40px, so the reset.css basically resets all the CSS in all the browsers, so when anyone views the page its same across all the different browsers.
   
  
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
  * I have primarily just used chrome on both OSX and Windows, I havenâ€™t touched IE since ages and I feel more comfortable      in Chrome than Safari. 


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
