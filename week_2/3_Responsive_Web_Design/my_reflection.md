# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
  * Responsive design is designing web pages to reflect the ever changing screen size that the webpage will be viewed on. I think with the rise of mobile devices it is a necessity that every developer has to embrace and design for.
   
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
  * Well responsive design has come a long way, the developer has to make sure that he gives the best experience of his website to all of the users coming from a myriad of devices with different screen sizes and resolutions. Although most users prefer the desktop version vs the dumb down mobile version of the site, this can be fixed by properly optimizing the user experience for the mobile site.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them? 
  * I think visually impaired people use the VoiceOver functionality embedded in the OS to view and surf the web where everything is read out to them, so to design effectively for them means we should have proper alternate text for the images.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
